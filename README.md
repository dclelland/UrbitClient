# UrbitKit

Swift client for Urbit. Supports macOS.

> **NOTE:** This project is on hold.

Intended for use in my macOS urbit app: https://github.com/dclelland/urbit-mac

Using the [`king-haskell`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/2107) branch; please note that it requires a compatible version of `urbit-worker` in your `$PATH`.
